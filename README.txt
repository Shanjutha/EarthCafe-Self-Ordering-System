This file contains instructions on how to set up the implementation of my project. 

The file is run on NetBeans IDE. 

The project will be found in the “src” folder. 

The following external library was installed from:
http://www.jtattoo.net/Download.html

Also, in order to view the image of the logo when your execute the program, you will need to change the location in the source code. 
The logo is saved under the variable defined as "logo". It is used in EarthCafe.java, MainMenu.java, Payment.java, and ThankYou.java. 

Once you have made these changes, you will be able to successfully execute the implementation. 


Thank you!
